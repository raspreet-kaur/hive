WHY APACHE HIVE?
Challenges with Previous Technologies
Before Hive, there was MapReduce, a scalable, resilient distributed processing framework that enabled Google to index the exploding 
volume of content on the web across large clusters of commodity servers.
MapReduce provides batch analysis of massive volumes of semi-structured and unstructured data in Hadoop, but the MapReduce Java API is not
easy to program with, especially for non-programmers.

Advantages of Hive
Hive was initially developed at Facebook to summarize, query, and analyze large amounts of data stored on a distributed file system. 
Hive makes it easy for non-programmers to read, write, and manage large datasets residing in distributed Hadoop storage using HiveQL 
SQL-like queries. Hive has gained a lot of popularity due to its ease of use and compatibility with existing business applications 
through ODBC.
