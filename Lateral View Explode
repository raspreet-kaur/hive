Lateral View Syntax
lateralView: LATERAL VIEW udtf(expression) tableAlias AS columnAlias (',' columnAlias)*
fromClause: FROM baseTable (lateralView)*
Description
Lateral view is used in conjunction with user-defined table generating functions such as explode(). As mentioned in Built-in Table-Generating Functions, a UDTF generates zero or more output rows for each input row. A lateral view first applies the UDTF to each row of base table and then joins resulting output rows to the input rows to form a virtual table having the supplied table alias.

Explode function displays each element of collection data type as single row.

CREATE TABLE Products
(id INT, ProductName STRING, ProductColorOptions ARRAY<STRING>);
select * from products;
1 Watches [“Red”,”Green”]

2 Clothes [“Blue”,”Green”]

3 Books [“Blue”,”Green”,”Red”]

select explode(ProductColorOptions ) from products;
Red

Green

But I want to join with other columns like id but that leads to an error.

In that case, we need to use Lateral View.Lateral view creates a virtual table for exploded columns and make join with the base table.

We need not to worry about the virtual table as it is done by hive internally.

SELECT p.id,p.productname,colors.colorselection FROM default.products P
LATERAL VIEW EXPLODE(p.productcoloroptions) colors as colorselection;
1 Watches Red

1 Watches Green

2 Clothes Blue--
