Hive-Metastore
All Hive implementations need a metastore service, where it stores metadata. It is implemented using tables in a relational database. By
default, Hive uses a built-in Derby SQL server. It provides single process storage, so when we use Derby, we cannot run instances of Hive 
CLI. Whenever we want to run Hive on a personal machine or for some developer task, then it is good, but when we want to use it in a 
cluster, then MySQL or any other similar relational database is required.

Now when you run your Hive query and you are using the default Derby database, you will find that your current directory now contains a
new sub-directory, metastore_db. Also, the metastore will be created if it doesnâ€™t already exist. The property of interest here is 
javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL.

The default value of this property is jdbc:derby:;databaseName=metastore_db;create=true. This value specifies that you will be using the 
embedded Derby as your Hive metastore, and the location of the metastore is metastore_db.

We can also configure the directory for the Hive to store table information. By default, the location of the warehouse is 
file:///user/hive/warehouse and we can also use the hive-site.xml file for the local or remote metastore.

We used hive-site.xml for changing the configuration to specify to Hive where the database is stored. We used a JDBC-compliant database 
for the metastore because the default embedded database is not suitable for production. For providing these configurations, we used the
hive-site.xml file.
