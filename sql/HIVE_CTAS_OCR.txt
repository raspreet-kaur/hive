--CTAS stands for Create Table As Select

--ORC file is a binary file format, so you can not directly load text files into ORC tables.
--ORC stands for OPTIMIZED ROW COLUMNAR which means it can store data in an optimized way than the other file formats.
--ORC reduces the size of the original data up to 75%.
--As a result the speed of data processing also increases. ORC shows better performance than Text, Sequence and RC file formats.

--DEMO
CREATE TABLE orders_orc -- you cannot specify the column names, as we are copying the data from another table.
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ':'   -- not important, 
STORED AS ORC
AS    -- use of AS keyword while creating CTAS table is mandatory.
SELECT * FROM orders_r.orders;

--see SERDE
desc formatted orders_orc;
--if you want to know the custom format of SERDE.
--create table with STORED AS <format>
show create table orders_orc;

--DEMO1, create ORC_SERDE
CREATE TABLE orders_orc_serde(
order_id int, order_date string, order_customer_id int, order_status string)
STORED AS ORC;

--Now if you run the following, you will see SERDE being chosed automatically
show create table orders_orc_serde;
--And, row format is "ROW FORMAT SERDE", which means we dont need to specify "ROW FORMAT DELIMITED BY" with formats other than TEXTFILE

--now we can insert data into newly created orc table.
INSERT INTO orders_orc_serde
select * from orders;
