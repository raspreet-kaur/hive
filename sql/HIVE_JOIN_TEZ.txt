--TEZ is another framework/engine, which runs on YARN but doesn't launch MR job.Rather, it uses DAGs.
--following parameter will show which engine is being used currently to process data.

set hive.execution.engine;  --mr/tez/spark
--to switch to tez

set hive.execution.engine=tez;

--TEZ is relatively faster to run HIVE and PIG scripts, but TEZ is only on AMBARI.

--join orders and order_items, to get total revenue per day.

SELECT SUBSTR(o.order_date, 1, 10) order_date, SUM(oi.order_item_subtotal) revenue_per_day
FROM orders o JOIN order_items oi
ON o.order_id = oi.order_item_order_id
GROUP BY order_date;
