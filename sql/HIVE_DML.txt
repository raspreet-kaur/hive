--limitations of insert
--there is always auto commit, if the operation is successful and no rollback, unlike RDBMS
--tables must be bucketed and ORC format
--Alter table is not supported for ACID tables.

SET hive.txn.manager; --by default its org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DummyTxnManager, perfer org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DummyTxnManager

--So, to use update and delete on a table, your table creation should look like this.
CREATE TABLE DML(i int, j string)
CLUSTERED BY (i) INTO 4 BUCKETS  -- i is bucketed column
STORED AS ORC

---MANADATORY TO SET

set hive.support.concurrency=true

--insert records
insert into table dml values(1, 'hi');
insert into table dml values(2, 'hello');

--update record --YOU CANNOT UPDATE THE BUCKETED COLUMN.
