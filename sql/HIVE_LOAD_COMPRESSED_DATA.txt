--COMPRESSED data has to match with the structure of the table.(like format, num of columns, delimiter)

use order_r_partitioned
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/randeep89/largedeck.txt.gz' INTO TABLE deck_local;
-- it will also create compressed file ---/apps/hive/warehouse/order_r_partitioned.db/deck_local/largedeck.txt.gz

--You can also compress output of a select query while inserting data into table.
--For this to happen, you have to set the following parameters.
SET hive.exec.compress.output=true;
SET io.seqfile.compression.type=BLOCK; -- NONE/RECORD/BLOCK -- sets compression at record or block level
INSERT INTO TABLE deck_local SELECT * FROM deck_hdfs;
--above query will create a ".deflate" file, which compress data.
--Each insert in any case will create a new file where data is stored. Instead of delete data of a particular insert, you can just remove the file created by that insert.
